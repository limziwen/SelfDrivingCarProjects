# SelfDrivingCarProjects
A set of programs used in self driving cars, using python and open cv. 

This project contains several algorithms

Laneline detection
This detects lane lines from an image or video using cv2.

Binary Classification
A neural network to classify points on a graph. 


Deep Neural Networks to classify MNIST dataset
This model's accuracy is limited to around 94%, to increase the accuracy a CNN is used. A more effecient and effective way to classify images.
