# SelfDrivingCarProjects
A set of programs used in self driving cars, using python and open cv. 

This project contains several algorithms

1. Laneline detection
This detects lane lines from an image or video using cv2.

2. Binary Classifier
Uses feedforward, backward propagation to create a line to classify between binary data


3. Classifier
This uses convolutional neural networks to classify images.
